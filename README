ReadMe - Ubuntu Calendar App 
============================

Ubuntu Calendar App is the official calendar app for Ubuntu Touch. We follow an open source model where the code is available to anyone to branch and to hack on. 
The ubuntu calendar app follows a test driven development (TDD) where tests are written in parallel to feature implementation to help spot regressions easier.
