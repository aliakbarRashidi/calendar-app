Welcome the Ubuntu Calendar!

Currently this application is fully implemented in QML/JS.
All you need to launch this all is Qt5 and the qmlscene viewer:

$ cd ubuntu-calendar-app
$ qmlscene calendar.qml

To test the application on the device check out the "testrun.sh" script.

# Updating translations

Translations for the Calendar app happen in [Launchpad Translations][] and
are automatically committed daily on the trunk branch in the po/ folder.

They are then built and installed as part of the package build, so that
developers don't really need to worry about them.

However, there is one task that needs to be taken care of: exposing new
translatable messages to translators. So whenever you add new translatable
messages in the code, make sure to follow these steps:

 1. Change directory to the po/ folder: `cd po`
 2. Update the translations template: `qmake && make pot`
 3. Commit the generated .pot file: `bzr commit -m"Updated translation template"`

And that's it, Launchpad should take care of all the rest
